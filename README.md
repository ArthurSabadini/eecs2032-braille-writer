# Barille Writter 

This library was created for a project for the course EECS2032. The project is about creating a braille writer device, which can receive and read English text, and translate it to the American braille language, using solenoids and a custom driver circuit to mimic bumps and dots of the braille language.

NOTE: Create an IRdecoder file in Arduino/libraries and add IRdecoder.h and IRdecoder.cpp to it
This branch attempts to improve the input system by using interrupts

The sketch that should be uploaded to an Arduino to mimic the final functionality is the translation.ino file.
All files in the translation folder must be in the same directory.
