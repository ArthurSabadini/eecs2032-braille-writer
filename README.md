This library was created for a project for the course EECS2032.

NOTE: Create a IRdecoder file in Arduino/libraries and add IRdecoder.h and IRdecoder.cpp in it
This branch attemps to improve the input system by using interrupts

The sketch that should be uploaded to an arduino to mimic the final functionality is the translation.ino file.
It is needed to have all files in the translation folder in the same directory.
